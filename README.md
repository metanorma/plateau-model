# PLATEAU Model

This repository contains the PLATEAU v5.1 UML model and generates a browser-based visualization using LutaML.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.2 or later
- Bundler

## Setup

1. Install Bundler (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   gem install bundler
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

## Generate the Web Page

To generate the `browser.html` file from the QEA model:

```bash
bundle exec lutaml uml build-spa 20251010_current_plateau_v5.1.qea -o browser.html
```

This will create a single-page application (SPA) that can be opened in any web browser to visualize the UML model.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The repository is configured to automatically deploy the generated page to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions:

- The workflow is triggered on pushes to the `main` branch
- It can also be manually triggered via the Actions tab
- The generated page will be available at the GitHub Pages URL for this repository

### Manual Workflow Trigger

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" and select the branch
